Google documents do not allow you to create linked endnotes in a document.
This Google Apps script looks for existing footnotes in a doc and creates an endnotes section from that content.

To install, do the following:

1. Open the document you'd like to create endnotes in.
2. Go to **Tools > Script Editor** and delete the default `function` text in the editor.
3. Copy the footToEnd script and paste it into the editor.
4. Save and close the script and document.
5. Reopen the document, give the script permission to run, and you'll see a new menu item, "Create Endnotes" in your toolbar.
